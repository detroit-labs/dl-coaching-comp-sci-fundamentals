<aside class="notes">
<p>
To get started, I want to take a look at a very simple C program
and just break down what something like "Hello, World" looks like
in C before we dig any deeper, and also as a sanity check to make
sure that your environment works correctly.

<h3 id="org6d29c83">Hello, C.</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>In the lecture we saw an even simpler C program so that we could
look at how processors work. However, "Hello, World" is probably
the simplest practical program that we can write.</li>
<li>This program illustrates a few things. First, all C programs
start with a "main" function as their entry point. Statements
within the main function are executed sequentially until the main
function returns.</li>
<li>We can see that main returns an integer. This will be used as the
exit code for the operating system, to indicate a success or
failure.</li>
<li>Because we're keeping things simple, we've omitted the arguments
to the main function by simply declaring the arguments as
void. The specifics of this are not important right now, but
we'll be learning more about what this means next session.</li>
<li>We utilize a library function to print things to the screen. The
specifics of how to do this by hand are complicated, so we rely
on a library, in this case stdio, to handle printing for us. We
can see that this is included at the top of the file. Again, the
specifics of how this works are not important, and we'll be
learning more about this in future sessions.</li>
<li>Our program concludes with returning 0, which as stated earlier
will be reported as the exit code for our program to the
operating system. This line is actually unnecessary, as it would
be inserted implicitly if it were not present, but including
explicit return values for the main function is considered good
code style.</li>

<h3 id="orge995262">Compiling a C program</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The reading material provides more details about the specifics of
using the compiler in rudimentary ways, but for most of this
course, I will suggest using the following format for compiling
you C programs.</li>
<li>We will use the GNU C Compiler, known as GCC, to compile our
programs. There are many other C compilers available and they
each have their advantages, but GCC is a long-lived industry
standard with many resources and much documentation available on
it operation.</li>
<li>the -Wall flag enables all warnings. This will be of assistance
to you as you navigate the world of C programming, and may help
to point out mistakes that are easy to make as you learn the
programming language.</li>
<li>We provide the C source file we want to compile as an
argument. As we build more complex programs, we'll learn more
about how to give GCC what it needs to compile our program, but
this is also information that won't be important until future
sessions.</li>
<li>I have also provided the -o flag which takes an argument, that is
the name of the compiled program we would like to emit. If run
without this flag, GCC will simply make a program called "a.out"
and expect us to figure out what to do with the output.</li>
<li>We can run our program by calling it with a relative path in the
local directory. As we can see, this provides the expected output
of printing the string "Hello, C."</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="org80d6a90">Number truncation</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>One of the nice features of C is that because the data types
we've seen so far are all numbers, they can be freely assigned to
one another. However, there is no safety built in to such type
conversions.</li>
<li>Rather, the byte representation of the number in memory will
dictate what the value will be after conversion to the new type.</li>
<li>While it is generally safe to convert types to a type that has a
larger capacity, converting to a type that takes up less memory
will cause rollover if the value does not fit into the new memory
size.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="org1fff485">Number truncation</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>It's also important to note that there is no implicit conversion
of types. Doing division on an integer that would leave a
remainder will discard the fractional part of the result.</li>
<li>If the result type of this division were a floating point value,
we would see a more accurate result. When the type of a result
differs, C will use an appropriate implementation to convert the
value when possible.</li>

<h3 id="orgbc1b0bc">For Loops</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>If you've programmed before, you're probably familiar with the
for loop. Its job is to repeat a section of code while some
condition holds true.</li>
<li>A for loop is commonly used for a counting or tallying loop, as
it allows for an initial assignment or declaration, as well as a
post-loop operation that is commonly used for incrementing a loop
counter or accumulator. However, none of its expressions are required.</li>

</ul>

</aside>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre id="triangular.c"><code class="c" >int main(void) {
    int tri = 0;
    for(int n = 1; n <= 100; n = n + 1) {
        tri = tri + n;
    }
    printf("The 100th triangle number is %i\n", tri);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
</div>
</section>
<section id="slide-org4faf65c">
<h3 id="org4faf65c">Nested For Loops</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Loops can also be nested. This is an extremely common pattern.</li>
<li>Variables declared within any scope are only available in that
scope, so while the i variable is available for the inner loop to
print, the outer loop will be unable to see the j variable.</li>

</ul>

</aside>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre id="one_hundred.c"><code class="c" >for(int i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 10) {
    for(int j = 1; j <= 10; j = j + 1) {
        printf("%i\t", i + j);

    printf("\n");

<section id="slide-org4b9c36a">
<h3 id="org4b9c36a">While Loops</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The other common iteration mechanism in C is the while loop.</li>
<li>The while loop is a significantly simpler looping construct than
the for loop. It only takes a single expression, which is used to
test if the loop should continue. Because while lacks an
initialization or post-loop increment expression, any
initialization needs to be handled outside the loop while any
incrementing or other changes to the conditional need to be
handled within the loop.</li>

</ul>

</aside>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre id="gcd.c"><code class="c" >int u = 1026;
int v = 405;
int temp;

while(v != 0) {
    temp = u % v;
    u = v;
    v = temp;
}

<section id="slide-org8b1cfb0">
<h3 id="org8b1cfb0">Break &amp; Continue</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>There are two additional control statements we can use for
changing the behavior of loops.</li>
<li>Break immediately ends any iteration as soon as the statement is
encountered and can be used to exit a loop when some other
condition that is not accounted for by the loop control
expression is met.</li>
<li>Continue on the other hand is used to skip the remaining
statements in the loop body and return to the top of the loop. It
is often used to conditionally run part of a loop when not every
statement needs to be run for every iteration of the loop.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="org62b8ff6">Conditionals</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Conditionals are a construct used to control the flow of programs
based on some condition being met. They function similarly to the
loop control statements we've seen already, testing their
argument as a boolean value, but allow for branching of programs
into different paths of execution.</li>

</ul>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-org5925687">
<h3 id="org5925687">If &amp; else</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The if statement is the fundamental way we have of control the
flow of our program.</li>
<li>An if statement takes as its argument a conditional statement
that will be evaluated as a boolean, thus any non-zero value will
be considered true, and a zero will be false. In the case that
the boolean is non-zero, the statements inside the braces after
the if statement will be executed. Otherwise, these statements
are ignored.</li>
<li>The if statement may be followed by an optional else
statement. If it is, then not only is the statement block
provided after the if statement skipped, but also the
statement block following else is executed.</li>

</ul>

    i = 10;

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>We've seen enough of these already, so it's probably worth taking
a moment to go through the relational operators available to us.</li>
<li>The relational operators are our primary source for determining
the boolean value for some statement.</li>
