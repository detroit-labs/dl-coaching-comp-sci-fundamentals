<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>First up are what are generally know as "The 4 Principles of
Object Oriented Design" or other similarly official-sounding titles.</li>
<li>These are the principles that inspired the feature set for
object-oriented programming languages such as C++.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Encapsulation is the hiding of data implementation by restricting
access to accessors and mutators.</li>
<li>Accessors</li>
<li>Mutators</li>
<li>Hiding the internal representation helps prevent users from
putting the internal data representation into an invalid or
inconsistent state. This is something we had very little control
over in our purely procedural programming efforts.</li>

<h3 id="orgc2ac4b7">Abstraction</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Abstraction is the process of developing objects and types to
represent real items or problems as we might find them in the
real world, so that we may think of them in terms of their
actions and interfaces as opposed to their implementation
details.</li>
<li>While encapsulation is the process of actually hiding the
implementation details of an object, abstraction focuses on
modeling objects and types as we would like to think about them
in the context of developing software.</li>

</ul>

</aside>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object
that distinguish it from all other kinds of object and thus provide
crisply defined conceptual boundaries, relative to the perspective
of the viewer.

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Thus, encapsulation and abstraction are closely related. While
encapsulation with the use of private members protects those
members from exposure to users, abstraction gives us their public
interface such that we might push things onto or pop things off
of a stack.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship.</li>
<li>That is, with inheritance, objects share properties and/or
functionality based on their membership in categories of other
objects.</li>
<li>In inheritance, classes can declare that they inherit from other
classes, which give them some or all of their functionality to
use, modify, customize or supplement.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Polymorphism is the principle in which objects of shared
hierarchies (that is, similar inheritance) can respond to the
same operations or messages with different results.</li>
<li>We might send a container the "add" message and not concern
ourselves with exactly how the container chooses to add its
elements.</li>
<li>Similarly, we might have methods or functions that take objects
belonging to a particular hierarchy as parameters, without
concern for which specific type the object is.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Each class should only do one thing.</li>
<li>To this end, classes should be loosely coupled but highly cohesive.</li>
<li>Uncle Bob Martin suggests that we think of this as the single
change principle. If we can think of more than one reason to
change a class, it probably has more than one responsibility.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Software entities should be open for extension but closed for
modification.</li>
<li>For example, don't hard-code strings, pass them as parameters</li>
<li>Classes should allow overriding of parameters and methods that
could alter their functionality to be more useful.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Liskov Substitution Principle states that subtypes must be
substitutable for their base types.</li>
<li>With this in mind, classes should not be designed in a way that
causes them to behave differently from their parent classes for
methods that only make use of their parent's functionality.</li>
<li>Unimplemented methods off a interface are a smell</li>

<ul>
<li>Clients should not depend on methods that they do not use.</li>
<li>Many client-specific interfaces are better than one
general-purpose interface.</li>
<li>"Sends login request" and "receives login callback" are better
than "login methods interface"</li>

<h3 id="org465752d">Dependency Inversion Principle</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.</li>
<li>high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both
should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on
details.  Details should depend upon abstractions.</li>
<li>Rather than creating instances of the what they need, creating
tight coupling, classes should take their dependencies as
parameters and use them.</li>

<blockquote nil>
<p>
At big companies, software tends to be written by large (and
frequently changing) teams of mediocre programmers. Object-oriented
programming imposes a discipline on these programmers that prevents
any one of them from doing too much damage. The price is that the
resulting code is bloated with protocols and full of duplication.

<blockquote nil>
<p>
OO has far too often been promoted as the One True Solution to the
software-complexity problem. But&#x2026;
OO languages make abstraction easy â€” perhaps too easy. They
encourage architectures with thick glue and elaborate layers. This
can be good when the problem domain is truly complex and demands a
lot of abstraction, but it can backfire badly if coders end up
doing simple things in complex ways just because they can.

<p>
Although reuse is a big win of object-oriented languages, it is also
the case that these languages have extremely poor modularity
properties with respect to class extension and modification. For
example, it is easy to override a method that should not be
overridden, or to reimplement a class in a way that causes problems in
subclasses.

The problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this
implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a
