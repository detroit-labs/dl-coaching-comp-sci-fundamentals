<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A data structure is a way of organizing data such that it can be
processed efficiently.</li>
<li>A data structure is a collection of values with a defined
relationship between them as well as functions that may be
applied to that data.</li>
<li>In C, we only had two primary data structures available to us as
part of the language, the array and the struct. A third if we
consider the packed struct as a separate entity.</li>
<li>Any other data structure that we created, like the linked list,
was composed by some combination of these two fundamental data
structures. In essence, the linked list in C was just a struct
that we placed an implicit special meaning based on the functions
that we chose to use it with.</li>
<li>With the addition of classes, better syntax and other language
features we've added in the move to C++, we are able to further
tie data and the functions that operate on that data together to
create more complex data structures and encourage or enforce
their use in more specific ways.</li>

<h3 id="org8127ff2">structs</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The struct that we are now quite familiar with is the compound
data or record type available to us in C.</li>
<li>The struct represents a relation between a specific number of
fields (often called members).</li>
<li>The fields are identified by their keys, so data in a struct are
related by a key-value relation.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The array was the other data structure available to us and
represents an ordered relation between elements, usually of the
same type in languages with static typing.</li>
<li>In C, arrays are allocated linearly in memory, making them
relatively fast for random access of the elements.</li>

<h3 id="orgda10995">Classes</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>We have since added classes to our repertoire of data
structures.</li>
<li>As we saw from our study of structs in C, a class is essentially
a special case of record type (that is, a struct) that also
contains the procedures to operate on that type, which we call
methods.</li>
<li>However, along with classes, we also got new features for
controlling access to our data structures' members, allowing us
to enforce proper use of our abstractions, as opposed to that
abstraction being implicit.</li>
<li>The inheritance capabilities of classes also make adding
complexity to a data structure based on existing functionality
easier, more maintainable, and more understandable in the
creation of abstractions for data structures.</li>
<li>Thus, the addition of classes as a fundamental data type in C++
as compared to C facilitates the creation of more complex and
rich data structures with less concern for users of the data
structure about how to use the data structure correctly.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Also known as a sequence</li>
<li>Represents a countable number of ordered values. The value of the
elements is inconsequential, so a list could contain many
elements of the same value.</li>
<li>Most commonly, this is implemented as a form of linked list,
whether singly or doubly linked. These involve list elements that
contain a value as well as a pointer to the other elements in the
list.</li>
<li>Because of the inherently expandable nature of the linked list
collections, the linked list is often used for collection and
iterating over variable or ambiguous amounts of data.</li>

<h3 id="org6b4d614">Associative Array</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Also known as a map, dictionary, symbol table.</li>
<li>An associative array is an collection in which keys are
associated with values in a one-to-one relation. It makes no
guarantees about ordering and should be considered unordered.</li>
<li>Thus, the keys in a map are unique. The value of the elements is
inconsequential and may be of any value.</li>
<li>In many implementations, these will take the form of a Hashmap,
such as in Java.</li>
<li>Because a map is an associative structure, it is often valuable
for storing data that must be accessed randomly based on its
relation to other data, which provide natural key-value candidates.</li>

<h3 id="org6b13c98">Multimap</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A multimap is similar in functionality to an associative array,
storing elements based on a key-value relationship.</li>
<li>However, unlike a normal map, multiple values may be associated
with a single key.</li>
<li>Depending on the implementation, a multimap may be implemented as
a map of keys to lists or sets, or in the case of the STL, as a
self-balancing binary tree.</li>
<li>Multimaps are often used in algorithms which involve classifying
many pieces of data into categories, which can later be retrieved
as a collection.</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orgfdeaab3">
<h3 id="orgfdeaab3">Set</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Speaking of sets, a set is an unordered, non-associative
container type that does not allow duplicate values.</li>
<li>Sets are unique in that they are not often used to retrieve
single values since they are neither associative nor ordered, but
rather to test other values for membership in the set.</li>
<li>Sets commonly have operations available to compare them to other
sets, providing unions, intersections, and differences.</li>

</ul>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre><code class="c++" >std::set&lt;std::string> strings;
strings.insert("first");
strings.insert("second");
strings.insert("third");
// returns true if value is found
strings.find("second") != strings.end();

<section id="slide-org30ed13d">
<h3 id="org30ed13d">Multiset</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Also sometimes called a bag</li>
<li>A multiset is an interesting data structure in that it keeps
track of unique values, but also keeps track of the members
associated with each value.</li>
<li>Multisets may keep track of values that are considered to be
identical, simply keeping a count of the number of instances, or
they may keep track of references to individual instances of the
values considered to be identical in the set (acting somewhat
similarly to a multimap).</li>
<li>Multisets often find use in algorithms requiring tracking
associations among many objects, such as in group-by operations.</li>

<section id="slide-orgee387ab">
<h3 id="orgee387ab">Stack</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A stack is an ordered collection with a tiny set of principal
operations, push and pop.</li>
<li>A normal stack keeps track of its elements in a LIFO order, so
the last-added elements are the first to be retrieved, whereas
earlier items will be retrieved in the opposite order that they
were added.</li>
<li>Stacks are common in algorithms where keeping track of a sequence
of operations is important, such as in depth-first searches.</li>

<h3 id="org104365b">Queue</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Queue is an ordered collection similar to a stack, however its
operation is in a FIFO order, such that the earliest-added item
will always be the first to be removed, whereas other items will
build up in the queue until earlier items are removed.</li>
<li>Queues are common in algorithms that involve multiprocessing,
used as a buffer to allow to multiple entities to add to and
remove from the queue.</li>

<h3 id="org6b65e14">Deque</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A deque or double-ended queue is similar to a queue or a stack,
however, items can be pushed or popped from both ends.</li>
<li>A deque is useful for situations where the context of whether the
oldest or newest items need to be processed at any point.</li>
<li>One such algorithm is A-steal job scheduling used in IBM's thread
building blocks.</li>

<h3 id="orge4c3efb">Priority Queue</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A priority queue is like a stack or a queue, but elements are
inserted with a priority.</li>
<li>When an element is to be removed from the queue, the queue then
serves up the element with the highest priority, as opposed to
returning or removing the elements based on what order they were
placed in the collection.</li>
<li>Priority queues are used in a number of algorithms that involve
preferential treatment of certain elements when the internal
sorting or retrieval of the queue is implemented efficiently,
specifically in search or encoding algorithms.</li>

<h3 id="org96fd6b3">Tree</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A tree is a data structure which abstracts around a hierarchical
structure, similar to a tree.</li>
<li>Some implementations represent nodes each containing a value as
well as a number of children similar to a linked linst, with
nodes not containing children known as leaves.</li>
<li>Other implementations may have all values stored as leaves, with
nodes containing only references to their children. This is known
as an ordered tree or plane tree.</li>
<li>The most common form is the binary tree, where each node contains
a reference to at most 2 child nodes. Binary trees are extremely
useful in search and recursive algorithms, particularly when they
maintain a sorted structure.</li>

<h3 id="org22b46ac">Graph</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A graph is somewhat like a tree in that it contains nodes with
links to other nodes. However, unlike a tree, in a graph cyclical
references are allowed between the nodes, making this an
associative rather than hierarchical structure.</li>
<li>The nodes in a graph are generally referred to as vertices, while
the connections between these nodes, are known as edges.</li>
<li>The edges in a graph may be directional, in which case it is
considered a directed graph, or weighted for a weighted graph.</li>
<li>Graphs can be important in many searching, matching and coding
algorithms.</li>
