<ul>
<li>To go along with our discussion of data structures and algorithms,
this section of the book is going to introduce some of the tools
that will assist us in developing more complicated data structures
and algorithms</li>
<li>First, we'll take a look at arrays, which will allow us to
organize large numbers of similar pieces of data.</li>
<li>Next we'll look at structs, which allow us to group finite numbers
of disparately typed data.</li>
<li>Then, we'll take our first look at functions, which are the
primary mechanism to organize and group operations for our algorithms.</li>
<li>Last, we'll briefly look at some potentially confusing features
introduced by the book which, in my opinion, you should avoid
despite their existing for very good reasons.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>An array in C represents an ordered set of homogeneously-typed
data. It lets us keep a collection of similar data to be
referenced under a single identifier.</li>

<h3 id="org7da5f02">Defining Arrays</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>This line shows how we can define an array of ints assigned to
the identified "numbers" which is capable of holding 5 values.</li>
<li>The square brackets here are called the "subscript operator", and
will also be used when accessing elements of the array.</li>
<li>The memory for these values is allocated linearly in memory,
which will help us understand more about how they work shortly.</li>
<li>We can also initialize an array when it is defined by placing the
values to be assigned to its elements in curly brackets.</li>

<h3 id="orgf0d798b">Using Arrays</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The subscript operator is used to access elements of an
array. The number between the brackets is the subscript, but is
more commonly known as the index.</li>
<li>Array indices start at 0. This is because this is actually used
as a memory offset. That is, the first element is 0 integer-sized
memory locations away from the beginning of the array in memory,
the next element is 1 integer-sized memory location away from the
beginning of the array, and so on.</li>
<li>As demonstrated here, the use of the subscript operator works
with indices like this on any statement once an array has been
declared. So, we can use it to access the array elements for
assignment or to reference specific elements of the array.</li>

<li>This includes even more complex types than the number types we've
learned about so far.</li>

memory large enough to store the requisite amount of data.</li>

arrays of arrays. These are known as multidimensional arrays.</li>
<li>With the set of features we've learned so far, for now any array
must contain arrays of uniform size. In the future we'll learn
mechanisms that allow us to keep differently-sized arrays
together as a collection.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>While an array can let us keep an ordered collection of similar
data, a struct is an unordered composite data types used for
storing heterogeneously-typed data of fixed size. This is similar
to a "record" type in other languages.</li>

<section id="slide-orgf420921">
<h3 id="orgf420921">Struct Basics</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>There are many situations where it can become cumbersome to store
multi-part data as separate variables. This can quickly pollute
the set of identifiers.</li>
<li>When multiple instances of some multi-part data need to be
stored, usually a struct is the answer.</li>
<li>Struct members are accessed with the dot operator, similar to the
way array elements are accessed with the subscript
operator. However, rather than an index, struct members are
accessed by their member identifier.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A struct can be initialized similarly to an array by using curly
braces.</li>
<li>Initial values for a struct are placed inside curly braces in the
order they are declared in the struct. However, a struct can also
be declared by explicitly declaring each member inside the curly
braces, which negates the necessity of ordering the members the
same way they are declared.</li>

<h3 id="org7903680">Compound Literals</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A struct can also be assigned after its declaration by using a
concept called a compound literal</li>
<li>This is done by using the type cast operator, which informs the
compiler that the literal collection in braces conforms to the
struct type we are attempting to assign it to.</li>
<li>This is our first glimpse of the type cast operator, but we'll
become much more familiar with it in the coming sections of the course.</li>

<li>Earlier I told you that we can create an array of any valid type,
and that holds true for compound types such as structs.</li>
<li>Just like any other array element, we can reference a struct that
is part of an array by its index, after which it we can access
its members</li>
<li>Similarly, it's perfectly valid to allow arrays as members of a struct.</li>
<li>Array members of a struct that are dereferenced from their struct
can then be accessed using the subscript operator as normal.</li>

(void) and takes no arguments (void). It simply prints a message
to the user and then returns after executing its only statement.</li>

go between these parentheses.</li>

<ul>
<li>Functions can also take arguments. This function takes a single
integer as an argument, as indicated by the declaration within
the parentheses after its identifier.</li>
<li>In this case, the function receives a copy of the argument, so
the original value would be unaffected if that value of n were
modified.</li>
<li>Similarly, the values of n and i in this function body are
unavailable to other functions, including main, as identifiers
are only available within the scope (set of braces) that they are
defined.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Functions can also return values. This function takes two
arguments and returns an int. The return value of the function is
placed before the function's identifier. This will also cause the
compiler to enforce that this function does indeed return a value
of the appropriate type.</li>
<li>The default return type for all functions that do not declare a
return type is int, however I will suggest that you always
declare an explicit return type for your functions to assist
yourself and others looking at your code, as well as the compiler
on occasion.</li>

<h3 id="orga674a37">Functions, Arrays, and Assignments</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A note about arrays and functions. Functions can certainly take
arrays as arguments, however they work slightly differently than
normal arguments.</li>
<li>Rather than receiving a copy of the argument, in the case of
array arguments, functions only receive a pointer to the memory
location of the array. Because of this, not only does the
function not receive information about how large the array is,
but it can also alter the value of the array in the context that
it was originally used in!</li>
<li>This behavior may seem bizarre, but we'll be learning in the next
session what is actually going on here. In truth, C is saving us
some typing by performing a bit of syntactic magic for us because
passing arrays to functions is a very common operation.</li>
<li>For now, just remember that if you pass an array as an argument
to a function, you will also need to pass an additional argument
for how big the array is as well as knowing that if you modify
the contents of the array within the argument that it will affect
the original array back in the context it was passed from!</li>

<h3 id="orgf05ebb5">Recursion</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Functions can call other functions, and that includes calling
themselves. This means that some algorithms can be re-written
much more concisely and with simpler operations.</li>
<li>However, it should be noted that each call to a function takes up
a stack frame which has a limited amount of space depending on
the system it's being compiled and executed on, while normal
looping constructs do not take up additional stack frames. This
means that while it might be simpler or more elegant to write
certain kinds of algorithms, it might not be a good idea because
if you run out of stack frames, your program will crash!</li>

<ul>
<li>The book introduces a few concepts in this session's chapters that
I consider to be anti-patterns for good programming practice and I
wanted to take a moment to point them out.</li>

in C, but do not necessarily make for good programming practice.</li>

<h3 id="org419109e">Global Variables</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>In chapter 8, the book introduces the concept of global
variables. As we saw in the section of today's lecture on
functions, variables declared within the context of a function
are only accessible to the function itself.</li>
<li>However, you can make declarations outside of a function
definition. These declarations are visible to the entire program,
from inside any function or context.</li>
<li>While this may seem like a convenient shortcut at times to prefer
over passing around arguments, know that there are no separation
of packages in C, and therefore no namespaces and no safety built
in to where these variables or other declarations might be
seen. This includes any libraries that you import!</li>
<li>Because of this, there is a much higher likelihood of name
collisions with global variables which could cause more
complicated programs to act in ways that you did not expect!</li>
<li>In short, please do not use global variables.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Also in chapter 8, you'll be introduced to the concept of static
variables. These variables are not available outside of their
scope, but they do maintain state as if they were global
variables, and so after they are initialized, subsequent
references to these variables will be based on the last state
that they were used.</li>
<li>While this can be a boon to low-level systems programmers as it
can be a good savings of time and memory-allocation, it can also
cause programmers to have confusing state errors. I suggest
avoiding the static keyword.</li>
