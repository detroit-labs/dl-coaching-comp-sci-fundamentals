<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>You might be familiar with how we designate strings from other
languages, which is done with the double-quote.</li>
<li>As we've seen a few times but have not belabored, this is
distinct from defining a single character, which is done with the
single-quote.</li>
<li>It's important to note that even a single character in a string
is not the same as a char variable definition containing the same
character.</li>
<li>More confounding is that assigning a string to a char variable
will compile, and hopefully we'll understand why that is
acceptable shortly. This does generate a warning but is still a
potential point of confusion.</li>

<li>So, what is the type for a string? We can define a string literal
by placing whatever characters we would like in the string
between double-quotes, but there is no built-in string type in C.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>When we declare a string to be a character array, we're actually
getting a bit of compiler magic to work for us.</li>
<li>When we assign a string to a character array, the compiler adds
an additional null character to the end of the string if there is
room in the array. This null character is used by convention to
mark the end of a string and is used by library functions like
printf to know when to stop functioning on values.</li>
<li>This is why you will usually see string literals defined as a
non-specific size.</li>
<li>If explicitly defining the size of a character array to hold a
string, be sure to leave an additional character's worth of space
in the array's size to take full advantage of the compiler's
special treatment for strings.</li>

<ul>
<li>If you're used to more fully-featured languages, you'll be
disappointed to know that comparing strings can't be accomplished
with the equality operator for numbers.</li>
<li>This is because even if they contain the same data, or even the
same first element, arrays will never evaluate as the same from
via the number equality operator.</li>

<li>The null string is a string containing only the special null
character, which is the default for an empty string assigned to a

compare correctly with a char representing the null character,
which we'll understand more in a moment when we talk about pointers.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The null character is not the only special character available,
it is one of several escape characters available, each of which
is prefaced by the backslash.</li>
<li>The backslash itself is an escape character, and thus if we want
to represent a literal backslash in a string, we can do so by
prefacing it with a backslash.</li>
<li>We can also use the backslash to escape a single-quote to
define a character representing a single-quote, or to escape
double-quotes that we would like to show up as literals in a string.</li>

characters are still number values, just ones that are
interpreted specially based on context. Because of this, it's
still possible to use math operations on them, and potentially
change the contents of the string.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>It finally comes time to talk about pointers.</li>
<li>Pointers are an abstraction around a memory address, and are
denoted by the asterisk in their declaration.</li>
<li>A pointer can be made to point to any valid data type, and points
to wherever that type begins in memory.</li>
<li>We can find the address of a given value by using the address
operator, represented by the ampersand. This is often used to
provide an address for a pointer value to point to.</li>
<li>The pointer can then be dereferenced once again using the
asterisk, which provides the value of whatever memory address it
points to.</li>

<h3 id="org5180062">Pointers and Complex Data Types</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Again, pointers can be made to point to any valid data type, so
it's not only acceptable but common to create pointers to complex
data structures. This is especially common when passing large
data structure to functions to help maintain efficiency by
preventing the copying of large amounts of data into a
function. When passed as pointers, structs then become mutable in
the same way that arrays are from within a function's body.</li>
<li>If a pointer points to a struct, the pointer must first be
dereferenced before its members can be accessed. Again, this is
so common that there is an operator dedicated to exactly this
functionality, the structure pointer operator, more commonly
known as the right arrow.</li>

<section id="slide-orgb31cabf">
<h3 id="orgb31cabf">Pointers and Arrays</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>In session 2 we learned that passing an array to a function
actually passes a pointer to the array. Because of this, unlike
other function arguments, the function body was not given its own
copy of the array argument and therefore was mutable from the
context of the array, but also no information about the length of
the array accompanied array argument, so if the length was
relevant, we would need to provide that as a separate argument
ourselves.</li>
<li>As we now know, pointers simply point to a memory location. This
memory location, like every non-complex data type we've
encountered so far, is represented internally as just another
number. This means that number can be incremented and
decremented, and the resulting memory locations can be
accessed. Deep down, this is all the index of the array is - an
offset distance of memory locations away from the start of the
array.</li>
<li>Accessing memory locations in the way is actually more efficient
than using array indices, but this shouldn't tempt you away from
using the subscript operator with array indices unless you have
other good reasons.</li>
<li>Notice we also don't need the address operator here: the compiler
recognizes a reference to an array without the use of the
subscript operator as a pointer by default.</li>

<li>Previously I told you that multi-dimensional arrays needed to be
of uniform size. That was true at the time given the tools that
we had at hand. However, now that we have pointers, we can work
around those limitations.</li>
<li>By defining an array of pointers, we still have an array of
uniform size - 1 pointer per index. However, what those pointers
point to may be of arbitrary size. Therefore, by pointing to an
array of pointers instead of an array of arrays, the sub arrays
can be of undeclared size.</li>

<ul>
<li>As we approach the wrap-up of our discussion of pointers, we can
look at a practical use of pointers. Last session we discussed
the concept of a linked list data structure and its relative
merit compared to an array. We now have the tools at hand to
design this data structure ourselves.</li>
<li>A linked list item will be of some value and hold a pointer to
another item. To link items together, we simply set the pointer
reference of one item to the address of the item that we intend
to follow it. If we choose to iterate over the list, we can use
the handy knowledge that eventually we will come across a null
pointer (which evaluates to false in a boolean context) as our
looping condition.</li>

situations where you will encounter a pointer to a

something along the lines of object-orientation by having a data

operate on its data, or it may be used for higher-order function

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>While often we use the abstractions provided by the system to
manipulate numbers in memory, this is not necessarily the optimal
solution. It could be less memory or speed efficient to do so,
although those are rarely problems we may come up against as
application developers on fast, modern systems, and so we are
often just as happy to accept the abstractions available to get
our work done.</li>
<li>However, there are numerous applications where the ordering of
specific bits actually matters, and we may not be able to
reliably depend on the compiler to do what we need. We can see
here simply by looking at a short integer definition of the
number 15 - the bytes are reversed on big and little endian
systems, so if the actual bits in question here are important
outside of their context as a short int, we can't rely on them!</li>
<li>So, we may need to resort to what is known colloquially as
"bit-twiddling" - that is: manipulating bits directly.</li>
<li>This is most common when dealing with low-level programming such
as low-powered bluetooth or radio programming, or when writing
systems software that talks directly to hardware.</li>
<li>Take for example this completely contrived bit field / byte flag
/ bit mask which shows which of a devices telecommunications
services are available.</li>

<ul>
<li>To put this in context before we get into the thick of it, let's
think back to the way C implements negative numbers.</li>
<li>The actual formula for representing a signed number in C is to
add one to the number if it is positive, then flip the remaining
bits. In this way, the leftmost bit controls the sign, and the
remaining bits control the distance away from the 0 point.</li>
