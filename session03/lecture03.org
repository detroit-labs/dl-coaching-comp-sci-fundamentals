   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - Algol was a standard algorithmic language
   - B and C were created as a systems implementation language to
     facilitate the creation of the Unix operating system.
   - K&R C set the unofficial standard for C as it began to expand
     beyond use just to implement Unix, leading to the standardization
     of ANSI C in 1985
   - As C was adopted widely on many systems and the needs of those
     systems we taken into account, the standards committees continued
     to meet and expand the C standard to where it is now, the C99
     standard. When relevant, C also adopted features from its many
     language extensions or offshoots to bring back into the C standard.
